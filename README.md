Play the original DOOM in your Home Assistant dashboard. 🎮

## About

It is a well-known tradition that DOOM runs on everything. Calculators,
ATMs, pregnancy tests, tractors, thermostats, and even a
[LEGO brick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43ky9rpmMT0). If it has a
screen and a processor, someone will make DOOM run on it. It was only a matter
of time before Home Assistant joined the club.

This custom integration adds a dashboard card that lets you play the original
DOOM (1993) directly inside your Home Assistant dashboard. It uses
[js-dos](https://js-dos.com/) to run the real `DOOM.EXE` through a DOSBox
emulator compiled to WebAssembly, right in your browser.

The shareware version of DOOM (Episode 1: Knee Deep in the Dead) is included
and freely redistributable per id Software's original shareware license.

This is a fun effort, but it carries a vision: imagine a gaming dashboard in
Home Assistant with small games you can play, no matter where you are. Your
smart home, your rules, your entertainment.

## Credits

This project was entirely written by AI. Not just assisted, _entirely_ written.
The Python backend, the TypeScript frontend card, the DOSBox configuration, the
build tooling, the translations, and even this README. All of it.

It was built using [Visual Studio Code][vscode] with [GitHub Copilot][copilot],
powered by the Claude Opus 4.6 model. The process started with an extensive
prompt describing what this project should be, and from there, the AI handled
every aspect of the implementation. The whole thing took less than 2 hours
from start to finish.

It is wild how capable AI has become. What would have taken days of work,
reading documentation, debugging edge cases, and wiring everything together,
was done in a single sitting with a conversation. We live in amazing times.

Massive thanks to [GitHub][github] for providing Copilot free of charge. 🙏

No kittens or octocats have been harmed during the development of this integration. 🐱

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

   search for "DOOM".

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest release from the
   [releases page](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-doom/releases).
2. Extract the `doom.zip` file.
3. Copy the `custom_components/doom` folder to your Home Assistant
   `config/custom_components/` directory.
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & services** > **Add integration** and
   search for "DOOM".

## Usage

## Entities

The integration provides several entities, all grouped under a single
**DOOM** device.

### DOOM binary sensor

A binary sensor that tracks whether someone is actively playing DOOM on your
Home Assistant instance. It uses a heartbeat mechanism: the dashboard card
sends periodic pings while the game is running. If no ping is received within
3 seconds (or the page is closed), the sensor turns off.

| State | Label                  |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| `on`    | Ripping and tearing 🔥 |
| `off`   | Dormant 💤             |

### Quote/Fact sensor

An enum sensor that displays a random DOOM fact or quote. It updates once per
day and picks from a pool of 46 facts covering the game's history, lore,
development trivia, and iconic quotes.

### Current player sensor

Tracks which Home Assistant user is currently playing DOOM. When nobody is
playing, the state is "Nobody is playing".

### Session duration sensor

Shows the duration of the current (or last) DOOM session, displayed in
minutes. Updates in real time with a 1-second tick while the game is running.

### Total play time sensor

Tracks the cumulative time spent playing DOOM across all sessions, displayed
in hours. This value persists across restarts.

### Sessions played sensor

A counter that increments each time a new DOOM session is started. This value
persists across restarts.

### Last played sensor

A timestamp sensor that records when the last DOOM session ended.

## Easter egg 🥚

True to Doom's legacy, this integration includes a hidden cheat code.
Type **`iddqd`** anywhere in the Home Assistant interface (yes, just start
typing it!) and a DOOM dialog will appear, letting you play the game
immediately, no dashboard card needed. God mode activated.

## Example automations

### DOOM lighting mode

Set your office lights to a hellish red color scheme while playing DOOM, and
restore them when you stop:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "DOOM lights on"
    description: "Set office lights to DOOM colors when playing"
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.doom
        to: "on"
    actions:
      - action: scene.create
        data:
          scene_id: doom_office_before
          snapshot_entities:
            - light.office
      - action: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light.office
        data:
          rgb_color: [200, 0, 0]
          brightness: 255

  - alias: "DOOM lights off"
    description: "Restore office lights when DOOM session ends"
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.doom
        to: "off"
    actions:
      - action: scene.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: scene.doom_office_before
```

> **Tip:** Replace `light.office` with your own light entity IDs. You can add
> multiple lights to `snapshot_entities` and `target` to cover an entire room.
